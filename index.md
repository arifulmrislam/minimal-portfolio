## Monitoring, Controlling and Cost reducing: Energy, Water and Gas consumption

### IoT Solution by LoRaWAN for [***McDonald’s restaurants***](https://www.mcdonalds.ro/restaurante)

<div style="text-align: justify">We have been working on a proof of concept since last year. We offered McDonald's to minimize their energy consumption. As well, their other consumption like water, gas and so on. We installed the LoRaWAN network in their one restaurant. Initially, we used five Eastron energy meters to collect different energy field consumption and observe the average consumption of twenty-four hours. We make a threshold that If the energy consumption is more than the set limit, It will create a notification and send it by mail. By getting this notification, customer will be informed about their unnecessary consumption. In this way, They can save their total energy cost at least 15% to 20%. We use the famous IoT platform Thingsboard and LoRaWAN based sensors.This year they approved our proof of concept, and We are working now with their other restaurants in Romania.</div>

### Datalogging with ChirpStack, Node-RED, InfluxDB, Grafana using Docker Container

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/arifulmrislam/Datalogging-with-ChirpStack-Node-RED-InfluxDB-Grafana-with-Docker)

<div style="text-align: justify">I build a local solution for our customers without using cloud computing. First I installed ChirpStack network server, Node-RED, Influx DB & Grafana as Docker containers in the Dell server. I create a database in InfluxDB. Using this database, I connect Grafana web application which is the open-source analytics and monitoring solution for every database. I use a microtic gateway to forward all sensor values to the ChirpStack network server. ChirpStack allows Node-RED to collect the data from NS using a topic. After collecting those values I forward them to the InfluxDB database. Using those data I create a simple web dashboard in Grafana application to visualization the values in charts, graphs and alerts for notification of the critical situation.</div>

### Advantech LoRaWAN WISE-6610 gateway and WISE-2410 wireless condition monitoring sensor solution

<div style="text-align: justify">For predictive maintenance, I used WISE-2410 transmits sensor data to WISE-6610 (via LoRaWAN) or 3rd party LoRaWAN gateway (via LoRaWAN). WISE-6610 provides Ethernet connectivity and supports Modbus TCP, RESTful Web API for integration. The WISE-6610 allows for VPN tunnel creation with various protocols that ensure safe communication. It also provides a network server that can encrypt and convert LoRaWAN data in the device, and its redundancy-enhanced functions are specifically designed to prevent connection loss. It has an inbuilt application server. Using this application server, I build a dashboard in node-red to visualization the WISE-2410 values.  </div>

## DataBase

### Deploy PostgreSQL fully manageable database for Thingboard

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/arifulmrislam/Deploy-PostgreSQL-fully-manageable-database-for-Thingboard)

<div style="text-align: justify">ThingsBoard uses the database to store entities (devices, assets, customers, dashboards, etc) and telemetry data (attributes, timeseries sensor readings, statistics, events). In this project, I am going to deploy PostgreSQL fully managed database. PostgreSQL is a free and open-source object-relation database management system (ORDBMS). ThingsBoard customers successfully use Azure Database for PostgreSQL to minimize efforts on database setup, backups and support.</div>

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/arifulmrislam/TEMPERATURE-MEASUREMENT-OF-SHEET-PACKAGES-AT-AXLE-ASSEMBLY)

<div style="text-align: justify">We have done a temperature measurement project for Cummins Generator Technologies. During this project, We need to read the temperature range of the electric rotor between 100 °C and 200 °C. We use two sensors one is the position/distance sensor, and another one is the temperature sensor. The temperature will check each rotor when it is passing through the rays of the position/distance sensor. The green lamp illuminates when the temperature level is in the set range. Meanwhile, PLC logs data as well HMI shows the values.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I performed comprehensive EDA to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict house prices. My best model had Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12293.919, ranking <b>95/15502</b>, approximately <b>top 0.6%</b> in the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>
